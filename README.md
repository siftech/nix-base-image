# nix-base-image

A base image used to bootstrap Nix-based projects.

If you're developing or using one of SIFT's Nix-based projects, you probably don't need to check this repo out.

Instead, the image can just be pulled with `docker pull ghcr.io/siftech/nix-base-image:latest`

(The project will also probably pull the image by itself.)
